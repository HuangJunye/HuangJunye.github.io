## 2020

- **[IndiQ Meetups](https://twitter.com/IndiQmeetups) @ Hyderabad & Delhi** (Feb 2) - My first talk in superposition! The talk happened in Hyderabad and Delhi at the same time (via conference call, of course). I shared my personal journey with Qiskit ([slides](https://slides.com/huangjunye/qiskit_journey), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj9IQTXDUFI)) as well as an updated talk on how to make games with Qiskit ([slides](https://slides.com/huangjunye/qiskit_game), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdkPd0T5GUs)).

## 2019

- **Qiskit Advocate Online Demo** (Nov 7) - I shared my experience of organizing the first university Qiskit hackathon (Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore) with fellow Qiskit advocates ([slides](https://slides.com/huangjunye/how-to-organize-a-qiskit-hackathon)).

- **[Quantum Future Hackathon](https://indico.cern.ch/event/838035/)** (Oct 18-20) 
  - I was invited by the organizer Oday Darwich participate in this hackathon at CERN. As a physicist (self-proclaimed), visiting CERN is a dream come true. I visited the CMS detector where the Higgs boson was discovered!
  - In this hackathon, I stepped out of my comfort zone (as you can tell from my blog posts, I am terrible at writing) and made a quantum story telling game: Woliverse. You can [play it here](https://huangjunye.github.io/Wolfiverse/).
  - After the hackathon, I followed Jack Hidary, Director of AI and Quantum at Alphabet X to visit EPFL, ETH Zurich and Google Zurich. I also visited IBM Research Zurich thanks to James Wootton's invitation.

- **[Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore](https://www.quantumlah.org/about/highlight/2019-10-hackathon-quantum-coding)** (Oct 11-12)
  - This was the first ever university Qiskit hackathon in the world! I organized it together with Anurag Saha Roy and Evon Tan from Centre for Quantum Technologies.
  - It was the debut of my public speaking career! I gave an introduction to how to make games with Qiskit ([slides](https://slides.com/huangjunye/qiskit_game)) at Qiskit Hackathon @ Singapore.
  - I wrote [an article](https://huangjunye.github.io/Qiskit-Hackathon-SG/) about the journey of organizing the hackathon.

- **[Qiskit Camp 2019](https://medium.com/qiskit/recap-of-qiskit-camp-2019-4d95f07dd179)** (Feb 26 - Mar 1) - This was the beginning of my new career and birth of [QPong](https://github.com/HuangJunye/QPong).
