- **[IndiQ Meetups](https://twitter.com/IndiQmeetups) @ Hyderabad & Delhi** (Feb 2) - My first talk in superposition! The talk happened in Hyderabad and Delhi at the same time (via conference call, of course). I shared my personal journey with Qiskit ([slides](https://slides.com/huangjunye/qiskit_journey)) as well as an updated talk on how to make games with Qiskit ([slides](https://slides.com/huangjunye/qiskit_game)).
