    <meta name="description" content="I didn't write a post in April, and June is around the corner. I can't procrastinate any more. I think I just put too much pressure for myself to write only "perfect" blogposts that at the end I am too afraid to start writing. I should just take it easy. Anyway, no one will give a shit for what I am writing here. In fact, there won't be anyone reading this post probably.
As mentioned in a previous post, I wanted to become a theoretical physicist and I was struggling to get admitted to graduate school. I found a professor, Prof Kwek, who is kind enough to take me as a PhD student, but he is not very optimistic about the application. So he suggested me to work on a project and write a paper before I submit the application. I started to work on quantum random walk suggested by Prof Kwek. After a while, I felt I wasn't ready for a theoretical physics PhD. This thought wasn't induced by the difficulties of the quantum random walk project though; I am having great progress on it. But after thinking about my PhD for many many times, I realised my physics foundation is too weak. It will take me minimal one year of full time efforts to learn quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and electrodynamics, which are absolutely essential for a PhD on quantum information. Furthermore, this estimation of one year efforts is over optimistic. I barely use mathematics for my undergraduate. It will take me sometime to get comfortable and confident of using mathematics.
With these thoughts, I decided to look for a research assistant position in a physics lab so that I can catch up with physics while working. However, finding a RA position in a physics lab is no easier than finding a PhD in a physics lab. I tried to contact a few professors but the results were all negative. Who will prefer to hire someone with little research experience in physics and come from non-physics background to do physics research? Meanwhile, my girlfriend just got a confirmation of PhD scholarship. I suddenly felt impatient and hopeless. Maybe I shouldn't try to walk the tougher way. Why don't I just stick with materials science? Maybe physics is really not my thing. I was desperate. Finally I sent out an email to a professor who I have been following for a while. His main research interest is spintronics on graphene. Since it's at least related to materials, I thought I might have a chance to do PhD under him. I got his reply only seconds after I sent my email. To my surprise, he not only wants me to do PhD under him, but also to work at the same time as a research assistant to manage the lab. It's a perfect match for me! I can clear my 6 year bond from undergraduate scholarship and do a PhD in physics, although not theoretical physics that I intended to do initially.
The name of this professor is Barbaros Özyilmaz. He is a German, probably with Turkish ancestry deduced from his surname. He is in his early 40s, but he is already a full professor in not just one, but two departments in NUS: Department of Physics and Department of Materials Science and Engineering. He obtained his PhD on spintronics in New York University in 2004 and then he went to Philip Kim's lab in Columbia University in 2005 to work on the newly discovered graphene. He was involved in two highly cited (&gt;3500 citations) : Roll-to-roll production of 30-inch graphene films for transparent electrodes, and Energy band-gap engineering of graphene nanoribbons. He is an expert in spintronics, especially in graphene-based spintronics. If everything goes smoothly, I will work on spintronics application based on another 2D material. Things cannot be more perfect.
There is only one catch: I need to become a permanent resident of Singapore. His funding can only hire Singaporeans or Singapore PRs. Luckily, I already applied for it two months ago, and I should get the approval at latest in September. It is usually easy to get approval for people like me who have studied undergraduate in Singapore with a scholarship. But I don't like the feeling of "all my future is depending on this and I can do nothing about it". I just hope everything will go well and finally I can start working on physics research. If my PR application gets rejected, I will take it as destiny. I will be really fed up with this PhD thing, and choose to do a startup.
