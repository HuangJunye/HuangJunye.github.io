I live in Singapore and work at IBM [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) as Quantum Developer Advocate.

I'm passionate about making quantum computing more accessible to the public, by making games, conducting workshops and teaching.

## 5 Random Facts About Me

1. I was born and raised in Qingyuan City, Guangdong Province, China.

1. I made [QPong](https://github.com/HuangJunye/QPong), a quantum version of the classic video game Pong.

1. I collect retro games and game consoles as a hobby.

1. One of my dreams is to travel to more countries than my age. I haven't achieved that yet (24 countries visited at age 27), but hopefully my new job as Quantum Developer Advocate will help me achieve this soon.

1. At one point in my life, I could (sadly, not any more) type sentences in [braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) at one time, when I was a volunteer teacher in a visual impaired school at Kenya.
