      <h1><a href="/2016/06/26/a-low-cost-braille-typewriter/">A low cost braille typewriter</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>This blogpost is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>, the Internet's own boy.</p>
<p>For his short lifetime (26 years) on this planet, he had made so many technological and social contributions to the society, including RSS, Creative Commons, Markdown, and Open Access movement. I am going to be 24 years old in October this year, and yet I am practically nobody. Nobody, except some friends and family, will remember me if I die today. I have studied in schools for almost 20 years. I should have learnt enough knowledge and gained the ability to create some impacts to the society.</p>
<p>Yes, I am going to start my PhD soon. And yes, if it goes well, it might be important. But I want to do something closer to normal people, not just some fancy 2D heterostructure devices. There is something I has really wanted to do for a while: a low cost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perkins_Brailler">braille typewriter/brailler</a>.</p>
<p>I went to teach in a primary school in Kenya 3 years ago during my summer break. That school has visually impaired students and the school is famous enough to have charity organization to donate braillers. However, there is still not enough braillers for every visually impaired student, because of a fucking Perskin brailler costs more than $700! A machine based on 20th century technology costs more than the most advanced smartphone in the world! This is absolutely insane! There got to be a way to cut down the cost. Here are my brief ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace complicated mechanical design by electronic circuits.</li>
<li>Use 3D printers to print most of the parts to avoid huge fixed costs in traditional manufacturing methods.</li>
<li>Find a way to type on cheap and easy-to-find normal paper instead of expensive braille paper.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not sure about the reasons of the high cost. I assume it's because of the complicated mechanical design and huge fixed costs that cannot be reduced by economy-of-scale due to the small market. I need to verify all these assumptions before moving forward. A new mechanical design might be even cheaper and more reliable and no need power source.</p>
<p>I have found <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezlibproxy1.ntu.edu.sg/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=974067&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F7681%2F20986%2F00974067.pdf%3Farnumber%3D974067">a paper</a> from 2001 by an Australian research group about an electronic design of brailler. It would be a good start point to make a brailler based on this design. One possible problem for electronic design is the need of power source, which could be a problem in extremely undeveloped regions. A combination of hand crank generator with a battery or supercapacitor is a possible solution.</p>
<p>For the 3rd idea, I am not so sure about the problem. I have tried to use a pen to indent on a normal paper, and the indentation seems easy to touch (read) and rigid (won't be flatten easily).</p>
<p>This brailler should look pretty much the same as a traditional brailler. The idea is to cut down the cost only, not to create a revolutionary next-generation brailler. There are many new innovations in braille industry, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display">braille display</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_e-book">braille ebook</a>. But they are all extremely expensive and quite useless. For visually impaired people in rich countries, there are many ways for them to obtain information, radio, TV, audiobooks... Braille is quite useless. However, for those who lives in poor countries, braille might their only way of getting information. An affordable brailler will make much bigger impacts in these countries. More people can afford to buy one, schools can buy more braillers for students.</p>
<p>These all sound great and reasonable, aren't they? Why isn't there already a cheap brailler on the market? The reason is exactly because no one in rich country cares about brailler any more. No one is going to buy a brailler and no market means no innovation. I haven't really started to work on it because I thought I can't make it and I didn't have time to make it until today i realised these are all excuses. I am going to start doing this thing from today. It will be my side project during PhD. I will devote my spare time to work on it. And I will make it open source. And if I really make it I will try to contact some organisations to support me for manufacturing or launch kickstarter campaign. It shouldn't just lie on my bedroom or on the Internet. It must create real impacts in the world.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2016/06/17/university-rankings/">University Rankings</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>NTU loves rankings. If you go to its official website, you can see most of its news highlights are about rankings:</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=a69ccf5b-a0ee-497f-9e17-5d107383b133">NTU is the 3rd in Asia and 1st in research citations</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=1019cb80-115a-4978-8c59-2e741052f145">Top in Singapore, 32nd globally. 5th in Chemistry, 27th in Physical Sciences in Nature Index 2016</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=bedc4e0d-8bb1-4874-b3fb-09d5d3cedbaa">No.2 among the world's young universities. NTU.</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=399b3b92-74a5-45d2-961c-25973663170f">Singapore's no. 1 MBA programme. NTU jumps 11 places to 29th globally.</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=52a28739-5ba9-472b-b528-21d56d450975">NTU is ranked No.1 for the 2nd consecutive year in QS young universities world ranking</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=7d250436-388e-4db9-b8ac-2327f2d06fe0">NTU jumps 114 places in 4 years</a>"</p>
<p>"<a href="http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=30089ded-0349-42a3-b180-7176bb19f96d">NTU charges ahead to no.13 globally</a>"</p>
<p>It's a bit too much, isn't it? When I started my undergraduate study in 2011, NTU was only ranked <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/the-7-fastest-rising-young-universities-in-the-world/2019337.article">169th</a> in Times Higher Education ranking. Now, it's <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/nanyang-technological-university?ranking-dataset=133819">55th</a>. In QS ranking, which in general ranks NTU much higher than THE ranking, NTU now is <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/nanyang-technological-university-singapore-ntu#wur">13th</a> in the world, just one place behind its old brother NUS.</p>
<p>The subject ranking is even more exaggerating, especially for materials science. QS ranks NTU at <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2016/materials-sciences#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=">6th</a>, and US News ranks NTU at <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/materials-science">2nd</a>, surpassing all the world class universities, like Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Cambridge, only behind MIT.</p>
<p>As a alumnus of School of Materials Science and Engineering at NTU, I am of course more than thrilled to know that our school (actually the subject ranking ranks all the materials science related papers published across all the schools in NTU, rather than only MSE) is on par with the world's best. But I clearly know that these rankings can't give the whole picture. There is no doubt that NTU publishes high impact papers, and in a huge amount, which is basically what the methodologies of these rankings are based on. But most of NTU research are just good, not excellent. We have a lot of Advanced Materials, JACS, EES, ACS nano, nanoscale papers, but seldom publish Nature/Science papers. There is not much scientific breakthroughs here. For this fact, I don't think we are on par with Stanford, UC Berkeley and Cambridge.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the inevitable flaws in any rankings, these rankings by different entities clearly show that NTU is on the rise. Like our president Bertil Anderson said in the email in response to the QS ranking last year where NTU was ranked at 13th:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know some of us may scoff at rankings, but I will argue that while it may be an imperfect and blunt measurement of the quality of universities, it is useful to young universities like NTU. It allows up-and-coming universities like us to benchmark with the best in the world and visualise our progress.</p>
<p>In the old days before rankings, legacy and reputation perceptions mattered most. Isn’t that even more imperfect, to have perceptions passed down through the centuries about which universities are doing good work?</p>
<p>It would be difficult for young universities to compete against the established ones without a more objective system for measuring progress. With the common yardsticks today, young universities can show how they are raising the ante in competition with the older, established universities.</p></blockquote>
<p>With these rankings, NTU can confidently advertise itself, attract better students, better faculty, and in turn push its research level to a new height. At the very least, next time someone ask me about where I studied, I can proudly say that I studied in one of the world's best universities and one of the best schools. :)</p>

      <h1><a href="/2016/06/16/next-step/">Next step</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I mentioned in a earlier <a href="https://huangjunye.wordpress.com/2016/05/21/phd-application/">post</a> that I will go to NUS to do my PhD. The PhD application is still processing, but I will start working in Prof  Özyilmaz's lab from 15 Aug. I will be working on the study of spin transport properties of phosphorene, monolayer of black phosphorous. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorene">Phosphorene</a> was first discovered in 2013 by a group of physicists in China. The lead scientist is called <a href="http://www.physics.fudan.edu.cn/english/index.php/using-joomla/extensions/components/content-component/article-categories/94-yuanbo-zhang-webpage">Zhang Yuanbo</a>, who was among the first researcher to work on graphene in 2004 while he was doing PhD in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kim">Philip Kim</a>'s group. Zhang Yuanbo became a professor in Fudan University in Shanghai in 2009. He is one of the most renown young scientists in 2D materials. I hope I will be as good as he is.</p>
<p>Prof Özyilmaz's group was also among the first to report about phosphorene and its electric field effect. <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/104/10/10.1063/1.4868132">That paper</a> has been already cited over 300 times, only after 2 years of its publication. Phosphorene is now the hottest 2D material, due to its low band gap (tunable from 0.3 to 2 eV) and high mobility (up to 1000 cm<sup>2</sup>⋅V<sup>−1</sup>⋅s<sup>−1</sup>). It can be used in energy storage, photovoltaics, thermoelectrics and of course nanoelectronics. The main research activity in Prof Özyilmaz's group is graphene spintronics. Given the rise of phosphorene, it is natural to expand the graphene spintronics activity to phosphorene spintronics. In fact, Prof Özyilmaz told me they already obtained great results and submitted the manuscript to a Nature series journal (Nature Physics or Nature Nanotechnology) So it is already proven that phosphorene is a proven great material for spintronics, and my PhD is guarantee to be a success as long as I make my full efforts into it. I'll be thrilled to be able to work on cutting-edge research and publish in Nature or Science journals. It seems I am so close to tip of ivory tower of research!</p>
<p>Ideally, if everything works well, I will be able to publish a few great papers by the end of my PhD. And I will be good to go to TOP10 universities to do postdoc. It is definitely too early to think about it. But me being me, I already thought of a potential supervisor for my postdoc: <a href="http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/jarillo-herrero_pablo.html">Pablo Jarillo-Herrero</a> at MIT. I am sure you will be amazed by his list of publications. Out of only 60 papers he published, 25 (21 in the last 6 years) papers are on Nature/Science (excluding Nature Communications)! His main research focus is quantum transport study in 2D materials, which is closely related to what I will do. In fact, Prof Özyilmaz has collaboration with him. They both did postdoc in Philip Kim's group. I can't believe MIT is so close to me. In the summer of my freshmen year, I went to visit MIT (just for tourism). I spent two days just wondering around MIT campus. Have you ever had an experience of feeling like in the heaven, feeling satisfied just by the fact that you are there? It's like a Muslim finally reach Mecca. That's how I felt. At that time, I was so convinced that I would do my PhD in MIT. I found a corner near the famous dome of MIT and wrote "I'll be back" using a rock. I'll be so satisfied if I can finally do research to MIT, even just for one or two years as postdoc.</p>
<p>I really can't wait to start working in NUS.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2016/06/16/writing-a-blogpost/">Writing a blogpost</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Every time I want to write a blogpost, I will have tremendous pressure. I don't want to write something that make others think I am stupid. I want to write something that is logical and thoughtful like <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/">Wait But Why</a>. But then, with all these things in my head, I will never really write a post. So, I decided, from now on, I will just write whatever that is in my head. No one will give a shit to what I write. In fact, no one reads my blog at all.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-525" src="/assets/blog-views.jpg" alt="blog-views" width="740" height="371" /></p>
<p>So fuck it. This blog should be my little playground, my own kingdom. Just treat it as a notebook, a diary. I just want to write as freely as I felt in my first blog on Baidu when I was in secondary school and high school.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2016/05/21/phd-application/">PhD application</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I didn't write a post in April, and June is around the corner. I can't procrastinate any more. I think I just put too much pressure for myself to write only "perfect" blogposts that at the end I am too afraid to start writing. I should just take it easy. Anyway, no one will give a shit for what I am writing here. In fact, there won't be anyone reading this post probably.</p>
<p>As mentioned in a previous post, I wanted to become a theoretical physicist and I was struggling to get admitted to graduate school. I found a professor, Prof Kwek, who is kind enough to take me as a PhD student, but he is not very optimistic about the application. So he suggested me to work on a project and write a paper before I submit the application. I started to work on quantum random walk suggested by Prof Kwek. After a while, I felt I wasn't ready for a theoretical physics PhD. This thought wasn't induced by the difficulties of the quantum random walk project though; I am having great progress on it. But after thinking about my PhD for many many times, I realised my physics foundation is too weak. It will take me minimal one year of full time efforts to learn quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and electrodynamics, which are absolutely essential for a PhD on quantum information. Furthermore, this estimation of one year efforts is over optimistic. I barely use mathematics for my undergraduate. It will take me sometime to get comfortable and confident of using mathematics.</p>
<p>With these thoughts, I decided to look for a research assistant position in a physics lab so that I can catch up with physics while working. However, finding a RA position in a physics lab is no easier than finding a PhD in a physics lab. I tried to contact a few professors but the results were all negative. Who will prefer to hire someone with little research experience in physics and come from non-physics background to do physics research? Meanwhile, my girlfriend just got a confirmation of PhD scholarship. I suddenly felt impatient and hopeless. Maybe I shouldn't try to walk the tougher way. Why don't I just stick with materials science? Maybe physics is really not my thing. I was desperate. Finally I sent out an email to a professor who I have been following for a while. His main research interest is spintronics on graphene. Since it's at least related to materials, I thought I might have a chance to do PhD under him. I got his reply only seconds after I sent my email. To my surprise, he not only wants me to do PhD under him, but also to work at the same time as a research assistant to manage the lab. It's a perfect match for me! I can clear my 6 year bond from undergraduate scholarship and do a PhD in physics, although not theoretical physics that I intended to do initially.</p>
<p>The name of this professor is Barbaros Özyilmaz. He is a German, probably with Turkish ancestry deduced from his surname. He is in his early 40s, but he is already a full professor in not just one, but two departments in NUS: Department of Physics and Department of Materials Science and Engineering. He obtained his PhD on spintronics in New York University in 2004 and then he went to Philip Kim's lab in Columbia University in 2005 to work on the newly discovered graphene. He was involved in two highly cited (&gt;3500 citations) : <a href="http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v5/n8/abs/nnano.2010.132.html">Roll-to-roll production of 30-inch graphene films for transparent electrodes</a>, and <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.206805">Energy band-gap engineering of graphene nanoribbons</a>. He is an expert in spintronics, especially in graphene-based spintronics. If everything goes smoothly, I will work on spintronics application based on another 2D material. Things cannot be more perfect.</p>
<p>There is only one catch: I need to become a permanent resident of Singapore. His funding can only hire Singaporeans or Singapore PRs. Luckily, I already applied for it two months ago, and I should get the approval at latest in September. It is usually easy to get approval for people like me who have studied undergraduate in Singapore with a scholarship. But I don't like the feeling of "all my future is depending on this and I can do nothing about it". I just hope everything will go well and finally I can start working on physics research. If my PR application gets rejected, I will take it as destiny. I will be really fed up with this PhD thing, and choose to do a startup.</p>
