      <h1><a href="/2018/11/17/feynman-lecture-vol-i-chap-2-basic-physics/">Feynman Lecture Vol. I Chap. 2: Basic Physics</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>It is incredible how weak my perseverance is. Just one week after my resolution to read and write about Feynman Lecture, I procrastinated. This summary was due one week ago! I did continue to read the book, even faster than I planned; I am in chapter 6 already. However, I stopped thinking again. Reading faster or more is not the point of this exercise. What I want to change is the habit of thinking. I should stop reading and thinking about what I have read.</p>
<h2>Summary of Chapter 2</h2>
<p>This chapter is about the most fundamental ideas about physics.</p>
<p>First, Feynman discussed about the scientific method. The scientific method is about observation, reason and experiment. We see something about the world; we think about why these things happen and formulate an idea; we then do experiments to check out the ideas.</p>
<p>To check the rules of nature, to verify our understandings of the nature, there are three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Examine the rules directly under controlled environment</li>
<li>Examine the prediction or consequence of rules</li>
<li>Understand by rough approximation</li>
</ol>
<p>I am not so sure whether I understand what Feynman said, especially the third way. For a better understanding, I should analyse a concrete example. For example, gravitational law says that the gravitational force between objects scales linearly with their masses and inversely to the square of distance between them.</p>
<p>In the first way, we can imagine doing an experiment to measure the gravitational force between two heavy objects, such as two balls. The gravitational force can be measured by a torsion balance. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment">Cavendish experiment</a>) I could change the small ball to change its balance distance between the small and big ball. In a series of experiment, I can find out the force dependence of the masses of the balls as well as the distance. This would be a direct proof of the gravitational law. Of course, this experiment is no easy task. The force measured is extremely small. To prevent air current and temperature changes from interfering the measurement, Cavendish place the entire apparatus in a wooden box. And he observed the torsion balance far away using a telescope to prevent his own mass from interfering the result.</p>
<p>In the second way, we can examine the consequences or prediction of gravitational law. This brings the story of the discovery of Neptune. Astronomers predicted the existence of  Neptune base on motions of Uranus that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets according to Newton's law of gravity. Neptune was later discovered pointing a telescope to the position calculated carefully using Newton's law of gravity.</p>
<p>In the third way, I don't know how to do it using the gravitational law example. But perhaps I can use dark matter or dark energy. I think right now we are understanding dark matter by approximation. We don't yet know what it is but we do know it exists, we know how much there is and we more or less know that it doesn't interact with other matter easily. From here and there we are gathering pieces of puzzles, until one day a breakthrough come about and we will understand it better.</p>
<p>Feynman then talked about unification of different phenomena. Heat, electricity, mechanics, magnetism, etc. were all considered different and unrelated. But later we understood, heat and mechanics are strongly related. Heat is just movement of atoms. Electricity and magnetism is two sides of the same coin: electromagnetism. Light is also related to electricity and magnetism; it is electromagnetic wave. This eventually brings the question: is there a theory of everything? I asked a related question to Frank Wilczek after his talk "There is plenty more room at the bottom" in Feynman 100 conference: "Is there a bottom?" Frank Wilczek answered that he doesn't know whether there will be a bottom or a theory of everything, but he think there will be a final theory. A final theory refers to a theory that not necessarily explains everything but most of the things in great enough details that we are satisfied with it. I personally don't believe in final theory. We learn from the history of modern physics that we can't settle for satisfaction. At the end of 19th century, the triumph of Maxwell's electromagnetism made people think that we understood everything. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys921">"In this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes."</a> Max Plank was so told by his supervisor Phillip von Jolly. What an irony to say that to the man who became the father of quantum mechanics later!</p>
<p>Feynman continues by describing our understanding of physics before 1920. More precisely, it should be physics before special and general relativity and quantum mechanics because both relativity theories were already discovered before 1920. At that time, we understood the universe is in a three-dimensional space of geometry. We knew there are particles such as atoms and electrons. We understood there are forces between objects, such as gravitational force and electromagnetic force. We understood that electricity and magnetism is strongly related and light is just a small portion of the entire spectrum of electromagnetic waves. We understood gas as a movement of particles and heat as the random internal motions. We understood there were different kinds of elements.</p>
<p>The description of quantum physics follows physics before 1920. The core ideas of quantum physics were introduced: uncertainty principle, particle-wave duality, probability nature. Feynman continues the story with his own field of expertise: quantum electrodynamics, aka QED and its prediction of anti-particles.</p>
<p>The last part was dedicated to the most recent particle experiments at time of the lecture around 1960. Strong and weak interaction was not well understood. Quarks were not known. Standard model of particle physics will need another decade to develop. It is for this part that I realise how fast physics has developed. We know so much more about all the particles and how they interact. We even found Higgs boson which gives mass to all other particles. We have a much better understand of how the universe was born. Although Feynman didn't mention much about condensed matter physics, but I could read elsewhere to know about the understanding of CMP in 1960s. Transistor was just invented. BCS theory was newly minted and we thought we understood superconductivity completely. There was no quantum Hall effect and the fractional and spin Hall effects. No high Tc superconductors. No topological materials. No cold atoms. No graphene and 2D materials. No perovskites.</p>
<h2>Questions for Chapter 2</h2>
<p>I didn't spend much thinking about any problems deeply this last two weeks. I should really change this habit. For now, I will write the questions I have for chapter 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>How do things get charged by rubbing? What determines which thing gets positive and which gets negative? Presumably this has to do with the ability of certain material to hold/attract electrons. But I would like to understand deeper. As least I should be able to explain why rubber rub against silk produces different charge from glass rub against silk.</li>
<li>Why is a AC current equivalent to electromagnetic wave? An AC current is driven by an alternating electric field. Is that equivalent to EM wave because the AC electric field will generate AC magnetic field?</li>
<li>What is the theoretical basis for uncertainty principle? Is it an axiom of quantum mechanics?</li>
<li>Anti-particle puzzle. Where is there more particle than anti-particles? Does it mean that there were more particles than anti-particles since the beginning of the universe? That means the universe was not born from nothing. Alternatively, maybe there is a way to get rid of anti-particles. But in that case, the conservation of particles will be violated.</li>
<li>What is the definition of anti-particle? I thought anti-particle is the same as particle except the charge is the opposite. If that is right, any particle without charges will be its own anti-particles. Perhaps this is only a necessary but not sufficient condition.</li>
<li>Can we always ask nature about " what is the use for it"? Is there always a reason for something to be?</li>
<li>What is the speed of light in media? Can we slow down light?</li>
<li>What are dark matter and dark energy? What is the distinction between the two? How do we know how much percentage they occupy in the universe?</li>
</ol>

      <h1><a href="/2018/11/06/feynman-lectures-vol-i-chap-1/">Feynman Lectures Vol. I Chap. 1: Atoms in Motion</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>After attending Feynman 100 conference last week, I decided that I should start learning physics again from scratch. At first, I thought it would be a good idea to start from solid state physics. Because it is not too difficult for me, and it is relatively close to my experiments so that I can benefits from learning in a short time and that in turn can keep me motivated to learn. In addition, if I find some gaps in my understanding, I can easily read some chapters on fundamental theories (quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, or electrodynamics, etc.) without digging too deep or spending too much time on them. On the other hand, learning solid state physics can also help me understanding more advanced concepts that are directly related to my experiments, such as superconductivity and spintronics. However, after reading a few pages of Feynman lectures, I knew that this is <em>the book</em> to start. I realised what I wanted to learn from physics is not only the physics knowledge itself, but also the physicist's way of thinking, or first-principle reasoning. For that, there is no better book than Feynman lectures. Just like what I learned from attending Feynman 100 conference (by the way, I still owe my readers an article about the conference, if anyone reads my blog, at all :P) and Youtube videos about Feynman, Feynman is a great teacher. He used the simplest words to explain physics. He really hated jargons. Reading Feynman lectures is a pure joy, because I feel I can think like Feynman, I feel smart! I spent about an hour everyday last week in the morning reading Feynman lectures. It was an enjoyable intellectual treat that I haven't had for a really long time. First time after a long while, probably after high school, I felt I could think clearly about some problems and started to question. This is a good start to train my first-principle reasoning. I didn't feel lazy to read the lectures; I actually looked forward to read them. Let's hope this will continue for a while, at least until Christmas? Let's don't be too ambitious. Do it step by step. My next goal to see my next summary/progress post next weekend.</p>
<h2>Progress Report Structure</h2>
<p>Because this is the first post of the series, I am going to say a few words about the structure of the progress report I have in mind. First, I will write a brief summary of the chapter. Then I will expand on a few concepts or problems that I found interesting depends on the time I have to think about the problems and/or the time I have to write about them.</p>
<h2>Summary of Chapter 1</h2>
<p>In the first chapter, Feynman discussed about his idea about teaching physics, which also reflects his view on physics in general. He discussed why we can't teach physics from basic axioms, why we need to first learn the simpler, "wrong" theory, before learning the more advanced, "right" theory. First, this is the history of physics. We first figured out classical theories to explain our everyday objects and then we figured out strange theories to explain puzzling experimental facts as our knowledge grew and the experimental techniques improved. We don't have the "correct" theory. It is important for students to realise that all theories are only approximations of the "truth". Therefore, it is a good idea to teach classical theories before teaching quantum theories. Another reason is that classical theories are easier to understand because we can understand them from our everyday experience. From there, we can build up our intuition and also our confidence in mathematic description of phenomena so that later on we can have some ground to rely on when things get very strange. In the second part, Feynman outlined our over-all picture of the world. In his opinion, the single most important concept in physics, or even in the entire field of science, is the atomic hypothesis that everything is made of atoms. He used water as an example to illustrate the power of the atomic hypothesis. He explained the different of atomic arrangement of the three phases of water: water, ice and vapour. We can easily understand why water expands in volume when it freezes to become ice: because ice has a hollow structure with a lot of empty space between the atoms. We can also understand why blowing a hot soup can cool it: we blow to move the water vapour on top of the soup so that it will keep evaporating and the evaporating vapour removes heat from the soup. Feynman carried on to explain dissolution and chemical reactions from atomic point of view. This chapter was wonderful. It stimulated me to think about many basic questions in science:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do some substances dissolve less as the temperature increases? (retrograde solubility)</li>
<li>Why does burning happen? Why do we need ignition to start a fire and how does burning continues after ignition? How are fire (plasma) and light generated from burning?</li>
<li>How does nose sense smell?</li>
<li>Why does Brownian motion happen?</li>
<li>Is everything physical? How can we understand things like consciousness from a physical point of view?</li>
<li>How to calculate the resolution limit of microscopes? How to calculate the diffraction limit and beat the diffraction limit?</li>
</ol>
<p>This week I only have time to dig into the first problem, retrograde solubility. I was particularly interested in this problem because I tried to understand it in high school when I was very good in chemistry and when I was still feeling powerful enough to understand the world by thinking by myself. I thought it would be rewarding to solve a little mystery that puzzled my arrogant young self.</p>
<h2>Retrograde solubility</h2>
<p>So, why do some substances dissolve less as the temperature increases? If you search on the internet, you will find an answer based on Le Chatelier principle. Le Chatelier principle tells you that, in a chemical equilibrium, when some changes happen, the system will adjust itself to reverse the change and reach a new equilibrium. Retrograde solubility is found in substances that produce heat when they dissolve, that is, the dissolution process is exothermal. So when the temperature increases, the solubility is reduced because the system want to reduce the heat of the system so as to resist the increase of temperature according to Le Chatelier principle. This is all very intuitive and satisfying but somehow I am not very happy about Le Chatelier principle. It's like Lenz law, Pauli exclusion principle or Hund's rule. These rules all sound like some words came up by some famous scientists. I won't believe them unless you give me proves! So I tried to understand the problem using elementary thermodynamics that I remember. An exothermal dissolution process means the enthalpy of dissolution is negative. (ΔH&lt;0) The fact that the substances can dissolve means dissolution lower the overall energy of the system, that is Gibbs free energy change is negative (ΔG &lt;0)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$latex \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S $</p>
<p>If ΔS is positive, ΔG become more negative when temperature increases, which means dissolution is more preferred so the solubility increases. Otherwise, if ΔS is negative, the solubility decreases. Put it more formally. In a simple dissolution chemical reaction</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$latex AB=A^{+} + B^{-}$</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$latex \Delta G = -RT ln K $ where $latex K=[A^+][B^-]$</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">$latex \partial (\Delta G) / \partial T = -R ln K = - \Delta S $</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">When ΔS &lt; 0, ΔG increases with temperature, K decreases and so do the concentration of A+ and B-. If ΔH &gt; 0, that is the dissolution absorbs heat, then ΔG is positive when ΔS is negative, in which case dissolution won't happen. Therefore, retrograde solubility only happens when dissolution produces heat. But exothermal dissolution is a necessary condition, not a sufficient condition. For retrograde solubility to happen, we need ΔH &lt; 0 <em>and</em> ΔS &lt; 0. How is it possible that the entropy reduces after dissolution? Entropy is a measure of disorder. A reduction of entropy after dissolution suggests that A+ and B- forms a more ordered structure with the solvent than in the solute A-B form.</p>
<p>For this part, I haven't found a definite answer. But it seems many sulphates ($latex SO_{4}^{2-}$) and selenates ($latex SeO_{4}^{2-}$) have retrograde solubilities. Sulphur and selenium lie in the same column of the periodic table, so it is understandable that sulphates and selenates have similar properties. I guess somehow $latex SO_{4}^{2-}$ and $latex SeO_{4}^{2-}$ can form large complexes with water molecules. The bonds have large energy combining with high coordination number produce more energy than the energy needed to break $latex SO_{4}^{2-}$ with the cations. And the large $latex H_2 O$ complexes somehow have more organised structure than in the sulphates which reduces the entropy as well. To get a more concrete answer, I will need to dig deeper in the literature. For now, I will stop the analysis here.</p>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of salts with retrograde solubility according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility_table">solubility table on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>$latex Ca(CH_3 COOH)_2, CaCrO_4, Ca(OH)_2, CaSeO_4, CaSO_4, Ce_2(SeO_4)_3$</p>
<p>$latex Co(IO_3)_2 \cdot 2H_2 O, Er_2 (SO_4)_3 \cdot 8 H_2 O, Gd_2 (SO_4)_3, Ho_2 (SO_4)_3 \cdot 8H_2O, La_2 (SO_4)_3$</p>
<p>$latex  LI_2 CO_3, Li_2SeO_3, Li_2 C_4 H_4 O_6, MnSO_4, Nd_2 (SeO_4)_3, Pr_2 (SO_4)_3, Yb_2 (SO_4)_3, Y_2 (SO_4)_3 $</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>博士读了快一半了，物理基础还是跟原来一样糟糕。再不努力打好基础，限制以后做研究的深度。其实之前就想过好几次要恶补物理，然而尝试了好几次都半途而废。我决定从今天开始要在博客里记录学物理的过程，作为一种自我监督的方法。</p>
<p>当然，真的要从零开始学物理，那就得回到经典力学，这样在很长一段时间内都不能感受到打基础对实际研究的帮助。所以我觉得应该从比较接近实验的固态物理开始入手，然后往基础的方向走补量子力学、统计力学和电动力学，同时也可以往更接近研究课题的超导理论。</p>

        <p>这几天在实验上遇到了一些问题，得到了三个人的无私帮助。这三个人中，一个是我们组之前的博士后，一个是我去年开会的时候认识的，还有一个人我完全不认识，我只读过他的博士论文。以前的博士后帮个忙，感觉天经地义。有一面之缘的朋友帮个忙，感觉也合情合理。但是最后一个人，我们素未谋面，没有丝毫关系。我只读过他的博士论文，发邮件问他一些实验细节。早上八九点的时候给他发邮件，本来还不期待他会回复，没想到过了两个小时便收到详细的答复。而我却花了一整天，到了晚上才回复他，而且还再问了几个问题。半小时后又收到他的回复。他说那天有点忙，第二天再回我。还问我今年去不去APS，去的话可以当面讨论一下。</p>
<p>从本科开始做科研以来，我只看到一些负面的东西，教授压迫学生、数据分析不严谨造假、教授之间勾心斗角等等，让我对学术界的印象越来越坏。这次得到众人的无私帮助，心里感到非常温暖，对学术界又重新充满希望。</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>这两天重新看了一遍亦明在2003年写的《中国学术界到底有多腐败？》。第一次这篇文章时大概是十年多以前，我还是初中生。那时候我对大学充满了期待，觉得大学是个很神圣的地方，可以得到很多大师的指点，学到很多其他地方学习不到的知识。那时候我听说大学很大，课间换教室要骑自行车。因为我妈上过大学，所以我就那天抓着她问大学究竟有多大，是不是大得要骑自行车。大学之大，指的当然不是校园有多大，大楼有多高，而是大师有多少。初中时看的这篇文章，打破了我对大学种种美好的幻想。它让我意识到大学并不是一个神圣而完美的地方。恰恰相反，大学里暗藏着各种腐败见不得人的东西。后来，我又看了覃彪喜写的《读大学，究竟读什么？》，对中国大学的真实情况有了更深入的了解。我对中国大学从向往渐渐变成希望。</p>
<p>不过，我并没有多少机会去验证《腐败》一文跟《读大学》中描写的中国大学。高考成绩高不成低不就的我，上不了中科大，只能去华南理工。本想着一辈子待在广东，结果阴差阳错地拿到了新加坡政府奖学金，到了南洋理工读大学。在新加坡自然看不到中国大学那般的百生丑态。但是新加坡的学术界也不见得非常纯洁，大概欧美也如此？渐渐觉得小时候梦想的神圣象牙塔其实并不存在。大师，其实到哪里都是稀有动物。</p>
<p>时隔多年再读《腐败》，有了不一样的感受。首先我不再全盘接受作者的观点，对他举的例子也仔细考察了一番。这文章的结构不是很清晰，论证也不严谨。常常快要说到点子上，却突然冒出一句，“不用说也知道”。另一方面，我对中国大学的腐败仍然感到失望。我查了一下文章里提到的腐败教授们，发现过了十几年，他们大多仍然逍遥法外。好几个退休、去世时，就职大学和科学院还撰文赞颂他们“为人师表”、“学术泰斗”云云。真正被抓的我只找到一个，就是褚健。13年被抓，17年被判三年三个月，减去审判期间的囚禁，审判后三天便被释放。</p>
<p>不过近年来很多有海外科研经验的学者回国，特别是实施青年千人计划以来，每年都有几百上千的优秀学者回国。这些有海外经验的优秀学者必然也会把海外优秀的科研操守带回去。这样长期下去，国内学术界的腐败现象，虽然不可能完全摒除，但是必然会得到改善。希望再过十年再读《腐败》一文，会觉得大家都过虑了，一切都变好了。</p>
